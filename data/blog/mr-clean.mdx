## Description

**MrClean.exe** is a fun side scroller made for the Godot Wild Jam #34. Although simple on the surface, using a tool like Godot proved to be interesting on the technical side.

With its **Everything is a Node** approach, it's easy to get confused _(I know I missed my Unity component system a bit at first)_. However, once you get the hang of it, it's a very powerful tool.
